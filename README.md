## Professional Summary

Hello, creating applications for me is an art. I am well-versed in various front-end frameworks and libraries, such as Vue, Svelte, and React, and have experience integrating them with back-end technologies Node.js, Java (SpringBoot) and SQL. I am committed to delivering high-quality work that exceeds client expectations.
